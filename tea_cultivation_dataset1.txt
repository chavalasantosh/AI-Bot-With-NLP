basic requirement of Tea grows best in warm and humid climates It will tolerate temperatures between 14 and 27°C (57.2–80.6°F) with 18–20°C (64.4–68°F) being optimum. 
Tea plants will not tolerate frost and mean temperatures should not fall below 13°C (55.4°F) or exceed 29°C (84.2°F). Tea grows optimally in deep, well-draining, tropical red soils with an acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.0. 
Tea requires an average annual rainfall of 1600 mm per year distributed evenly throughout the growing season. In growing regions that experience a long dry season, tea plants require shading to increase the humidity around the plants. 

propogation Tea is propagated from seed or rooted leaf cuttings Good quality seeds are selected by immersing in water for 30 minutes and selecting the seeds which sink
Seeds are commonly germinated by placing them between wet cloths Seeds which successfully germinate are transferred to a nursery bed to grow for 2–3 years 
Before transplanting to the field, the plants are cut back to a height of 15 cm (6.0 in) Leaf cuttings are also used to establish new tea plantations
Single node cuttings are taken from the desired variety and rooted in polyethylene bags containing soil by firmly pressing the stem into the soil
The bags are then placed in a shaded area and watered regularly New tea plants produced from rooted cuttings are usually planted out in the field after 6–9 months
Tea can be planted as single rows, double rows or as a hedge Plantations established on slopes are planted on contour rows
Seedlings or cuttings are usually planted 60 cm (24 in) apart, allowing 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows. The tea plants are often interplanted with legumes or grasses to conserve soil moisture and prevent soil erosion. 
Shade trees are utilized in tea plantations grown at lower altitudes. 

General care and maintenance of tea,Newly planted tea plantations must be kept free from weeds while the tea plants establish Weeding should be done by hand until the canopy closes and shades out weeds 
Tea plants should be pruned to encourage the production of lateral branches Busjes are shaped by tipping and thinning of branches to create the desired shape 
Pruning should be maintained throughout the life of the plantation to keep the plants a manageable size and maintain productivity
pruning is best carried out when the plants are dormant where possible If trees do not have a dormant period then they should be pruned in winter or after the dry period depending on geographic location
The tree clippings can be left in the centers of the rows to acts as an organic mulch Tea plantations are usually fertilized 2–3 times per year
The amount of each nutrient added to the soil will depend on the soil’s own deficiencies and should ideally be based on the results of soil testing or by testing the leaves for nutrient deficiencies.

Harvesting Tea is harvested by “plucking” which involves the removal of the youngest leaves at the shoot terminals The terminal bud is removed along with the two leaves directly below (fine plucking) or the bud and three leaves (coarse plucking)
The younger leaves have the best flavor and removing three leaves increases production but diminishes the overall quality by including an older leaf Tea plants are plucked by hand by graspi.

Blister blight is The causal organism of blister blight disease Exobasidium vexans is known to be an obligate biotrophic fungus with no alternate host completing its entire life cycle in tea
The pathogen mainly attacks young, succulent, and tender harvestable leaf and shoot thereby inflicting an enormous effect on the quality and quantity of consumable tea production
The pathogen reproduces through basidiospores which are commonly known to get dispersed by wind The basidiospores germinated upon lodging on the surface of susceptible tea leaf surfaces under a humid atmosphere with a minimum relative humidity of 80%
The infection is facilitated by the formation of infection peg from appressoria either directly penetrating the cuticle of host tissue or penetration through stomata
The first apparent sign of infection appears in young leaves in the form of pink translucent spots which are considered as the first stage of blister blight infection and are visible after three days of fungal penetration The spots enlarge along with the leaves and approximately reach a diameter of 3–12.5 mm
In the second stage, the enlarged spots develop into white and velvety convex blister lesions on the lower surface of tea leaf, and on the upper surface, the area with blister lesions becomes sunken resulting in concave depression
The disease progress to its third stage characterized by the curling of the infected tea leaf, browning of blister lesions, and consequently necrosis of the infected leaf tissue
The life cycle of blister blight disease is represented in During the off-season, the pathogen is reported to survive on these necrotic leaf parts which facilitate the infection to occur in the subsequent season under favorable climatic conditions In a study was carried out to detect the survival of E 
vexans during the off-season the presence of basidiospores in the atmosphere was reported indicating the active state of the pathogen throughout the year However, the spore concentration being very low (10 spores/m3) the basidiospores failed to sporulate
Under favorable climatic conditions, the pathogen completes its life cycle within 11 days, although it is reported at times extend to 28 days depending on the prevailing climatic conditions Owing to the short span of the life cycle, multiple generations of the pathogen are completed within a single cropping season
For the development of blister blight infection sporulation to germination takes place in 4 h to 5 days, germination to penetration takes 4–9 days, penetration to the appearance of visible symptoms takes 3–10 days, development of mature blister and subsequent sporulation takes 11–28 days.

Favourable condition of Blister Blight of tea is High relative humidity (greater than 85%), Frequent rainfall, Strong wind, Movement of labour during harvesting. 

treatment for Blister blight are Removal of affected leaves and shoots by pruning and destruction of the same have been recommended, Spraying of Bordeaux mixture or Copper Oxy Chloride 0.1%, A mixture of 210g of Copper oxy Chloride + 210g of nickel chloride per ha sprayed at 5 days interval from June to September and October to November,
Spray Tridemorph at 340 and 560 ml/ha is satisfactory under mild and moderate rainfall conditions.

Leaf red rust, It’s the most important algal disease in tea, Vigorous growing and high-yielding tea cultivars hasbeen found highly attacked.

Nature of Pathogen of Leaf red rust is Cephaleuros infection on tea has been called as ‘Red rust’ They are the member of Trentepohliales, the genuscholorophyta which contains the photosynthetic organismscalled green algae They are aerophilic, filamentous green algae They consists of branched filaments that comprises a thallus inthe form of irregular discs They are capable of both asexual and sexual reproduction Asexual reproduction is much more important to typicalinfection and disease process Unlike majority of pathogen Cephaleuros species it penetrates epidermis of plants. 

Symptoms of leaaf red rust causes severe damage to young tea by attacking andkilling stem and leaf tissues in patches, Affected patches on the stem become most noticeable when thealga produces frutification which appears during the month ofApril to July, The patches are oval or oblong in shape, During August- March the lesions appear purplish in color thereare no fruiting hair at this time but longitudinal cracks may beseen on surface, It causes chlorosis and variegation, It causes defoliation , reduce photosynthesis, loss of fruitmarketability, twig dieback and tissue necrosis.

Favorable condition of red rust is Bright sunshine, Disease emergence favored by high humidity and temperature.

Control measures for leaaf red rust causes By obstructing sunshine with the help of shed tree, Skillful pruning and plucking of bud leaf, Provide adequate space between plant to maximize aircirculation around foliage, 2% MOP and urea can be sprayed as a rehabilatory measurein the severly affected sections, Spraying of fungicides like calixin, macuprax should bedirected towards the young stems and lateral bearing rustyfrutification.

brown blight fungi are considered weak pathogens and usually only affect plants that have been weakened by improper care or adverse environmental conditions The diseaseis favored by poor air circulation, high temperature, andhigh humidity or prolonged periods of leaf wetness When young twigs of susceptible cultivars are cut andused to root new plants, latent mycelium in the leaf tissue may start to invade nearby cells to form brown spots,and this may lead to death of leaves and twigs.

brown blight Symptoms on the leaves appear as small, yellowish green, diffuse spots that later become dark brown, necrotic lesions with characteristic concentric rings. These spots develop from the leaf margin and spread inward (Fig. 5A and B). Later, black fruiting bodies develop in the lesions, and the spots can coalesce, blighting young leaves and causing twig dieback. The pathogens survive in decomposed plant debris, and disease development is favored by high humidity (>95%), and temperatures of 25 to 30°C as well as by poor air circulation or prolonged periods of leaf wetness (Liu et al. 2016).

Life cycle of brown blight is The tiny, black spots on the lesions contain the fungalspores Rain splash transports the spores from one plantor site of infection to another If the spores land on aleaf, they germinate to start a new leaf spot or a latentinfection.

Control measures/ treatment, solution for brown blight Avoid plant stress Grow tea bushes with adequate spacing to permit air to circulate and reduce humidity andthe duration of leaf wetness.

faouble conditions of brown blight is The disease is favored by poor air circulation, high temperature, and high humidity or prolonged periods of leaf wetness.

root rots Disease symptoms are Tea plants of all ages are susceptible to this disease. Affected Brown root rot diseasebushes occur in patches, usually around old tree stumps, but sometimes isolated bushes are affected,Plants become weaker and their leaves begin to turn yellow and finally wilt and defoliate, eventually leading to death of the plant,Longitudinal cracks are usually present on the collar above the soil level but also on the tap root and lateral roots,
Scrapping of the bark at the collar region reveals sheets of creamy white mycelia and the wood has a strong mushroom like-smell.

root rots Disease is spread by spores carried by wind, lodges on stumps of shade trees; infection spreads mainly through root contact and alternate hosts are Coffee, Grevillea, Albizia and Erythrina.

Favourable conditions of root rots Disease is common in low elevation areas Humid and rainy season favour the development of disease.

how to control root rots; Remove a and destroy all crop debris from around plants; prune out infected or dead branches from the plant canopy.

The Twig die back, stem canker symptoms include browning and drooping of affected leaves As the disease spreads into the shoots, they become dry and die The entire branch can die from the tip downward
Dying branches often have cankers-shallow, slowly spreading lesions surrounded by a thick area of bark.

Survival and spread of the The Twig die back The fungus usually requires wounded plant tissue to gain entry and initiate infection Spores are spread when splashed by rain and can survive for several weeks on pruned branches left in the fieldFavourable conditionsRainy weather favors its spread, and dry conditions promote its development.

Life cycle of Twig die back is The fungus produces spores on small, pear-shaped pycnidia on dead branches Spores are spread when splashed by rain and can survive for several weeks on prunedbranches left in the field The fungus usually requires wounded plant tissue to gain entry and initiate infection.

how to control The Twig die back is Plant in well draining, acidic soils; remove diseased twigs by cutting several inches below cankered areas and disinfecting tools between cuts; apply appropriate protective fungicides during periods of wet weather or natural leaf drop to protect leaf scars from infection.

Horse hair blight Symptoms are Black fungal threads resembling horse hair are attachedto upper branches and twigs by small brown discs Thefungus penetrates and infects the twigs from the discsand produces volatile substances that cause rapid leafdrop.

Life cycle of Horse hair blight This pathogen is spread from infected twigs to healthy twigs by extending its hair-like threads.

Symptoms of Algal leaf spot Cephaleuros virescens are Gray, green or tan raised spots or blotches with green margins on leaves.

favourble condition for Horse hair blight are Disease emergence favored by high temperature and humidity.

how to control Horse hair blight, Avoid overhead irrigation which can spread the disease; provide adequate space between plants to maximize air circulation around foliage; avoid wounding plants; prune out diseases parts of plants by cutting 6 inches below any visible symptoms; application of appropriate protective fungicides should be made in Spring when old leaves drop from plants.

symptoms of Algal leaf spot are Gray, green or tan raised spots or blotches with green margins on leaves.

Favourable conditions for Horse hair blight is high temperature and humidity.

how to control Horse hair blight Avoid overhead irrigation which can spread the disease; provide adequate space between plants to maximize air circulation around foliage; avoid wounding plants; prune out diseases parts of plants by cutting 6 inches below any visible symptoms; application of appropriate protective fungicides should be made in Spring when old leaves drop from plants.

Symptoms of Camellia flower blight Ciborinia camelliae of Small, brown, irregular-shaped spots on the flower petals; whole flower turning brown; flowers dropping from plant.

favourble condition of Camellia flower blight is early in Spring during periods of high moisture.

how to control Camellia flower blight, flowers from plants; remove all crop debris from around plants; soil drenches with appropriate fungicides can help to reduce the intensity of the disease.

Symptoms of Poria root disease Yellowing foliage; wilting and/or sudden death of part of plant; withered leaves remain attached to the plant for several days; uprooting the bush reveals whitish mycelium and red discoloration of the roots.

favourble condition of Poria root disease is Spread by mycelial strands in the soil.

how to control Poria root disease Remove any visibly infected bushes and any adjacent plants which are showing signs of yellowing; remove any stumps or trees within infested area; all living and dead roots which are about pencil thickness or more should be removed from the site by digging using a fork; all material collected should be destroyed by burning; bushes surrounding the infested area should be treated with an appropriate fungicide applied as a soil drench; cleared site should be planted with grass for a period of two years before tea is replanted.

Symptoms of Aphids are Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in color, but may be pink, brown, red or black depending on species and host plant; if aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mold on the plants

how to control Aphids; If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available; sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.

Symptoms of Tea scale Fiorinia theae Pale yellow spots on leaves; entire leaves yellowing; leaves turning brown and dropping prematurely; reduced flower size; adult insect is an oblong shape with a ridge down the center parallel to the sides; the scale is initially bright yellow in color but darkens to a dark brown; insect is mainly found on the undersides of leaves

how to control Pale; Light infestations can be scraped off the plant and destroyed or infested leaves can be hand picked; heavier infestations can be treated with a horticultural oil after bloom; appropriate insecticides can be applied but are only effective against scales that are actively crawling.

Symptoms of Spider mites Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visibl

how to control Spider mites; In the home garden, spraying plants with a strong jet of water can help reduce buildup of spider mite populations; if mites become problematic apply insecticidal soap to plants; certain chemical insecticides may actually increase mite populations by killing off natural enemies and promoting mite reproduction.
